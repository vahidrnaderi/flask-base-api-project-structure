# Flask Base API Project Structure

This repository provides a well-structured template for developing Flask-based API applications, using a microservice architecture with the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern and a factory-based approach for improved scalability.

> The project is meant to be easily clone-able, and used as the starter template for the next big thing you develop.
